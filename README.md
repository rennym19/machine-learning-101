# Machine Learning 101!

Intro to Machine Learning from scratch, including step by step instructions, lots of examples and no black-box libraries.

## Goal
My intention with this repository is to make a collection of ML-related topics, specially algorithms and techniques, in order to create a go-to place where anyone interested in this field can check some of its basics.

## Tools

The programming language chosen is Python, and with the help of Jupyter Notebooks, the documentation and instructions for every topic will be very visual and dynamic. Since this is a "from scratch" approach, there will be no sign of libraries like tensor-flow or sklearn. However, **we will use Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib** extensively, and if you are not familiar with them, check the tutorials available [on this site](https://pythonprogramming.net/data-analysis-tutorials/).

## Mathematics
It is true that Math is an integral part of Machine Learning, in fact, it all boils down to being able to generalize from data in a mathematical way: finding relationships between input and output variables, optimizing for an objective function and minimizing errors! However, it isn't true that you need to be a master of math. **The topics you should be familiar with are: Linear Algebra (this is the main one, in my opinion), Statistics and Calculus.** No need to learn them all before getting started, you can learn them or review them as you go. Odds are you already know most of what you need.

## Material you may want to check
I'm by no means an expert, but I'll do my best to create content that is both valuable and accurate, while also being easy to understand and avoiding as much blur as possible. In case you're curious, my primary (and favorite) source of information for basic ML is [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course](https://en.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) available on Coursera.

I'll be adding more and more topics over time!
